Welcome to Node.LA!

This app is designed for the plant enthusiasts of New Orleans. The program was designed to encourage and enhance the growing experience of growers in the Southeastern Louisiana Area.

Whether you're new to plant cultivation or a certified master gardener, this app offers a plethora of user generated information via forum and features a subnetwork of neighborhood message boards, perfect for commentary about light, best practices, and current events based on the ward as well as events and resources for plant parents of the greater New Orleans area.

Node.LA utilizes a MERN stack with an overlay of feathersJS and MariaDB with Sequelize, and Authentication & Authorization via Passport &Auth0 via feathersJS, React & Material UI for client interaction and styling.

To start the app, run `npm run start` in the command line interface to start the server, and npm `run start-client` to start the compiler.
